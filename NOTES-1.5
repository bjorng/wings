- Added the possibility to view normal/bump maps in the model window,
  for uv-mapped surfaces. [dgud]

- Added a Japanese translation provided by Tsukubado(tkbd), thank you. [dgud]

  has been loaded/reloaded. (Thanks to deerwood that reported this
  bug) [Micheus]

  selection" in context menu.
  (Thanks to deerwood that reported the bug
  and suggested the new options) [Micheus]

- Fix unc paths on windows
  (Thanks to jentzenm.unofficialsony that reported this bug) [Micheus]

  When trying to saving a wings scene file to a path on the network
  using unc path, an error occurs (Save failed: no such file or
  directory) and the file was not saved. For some reason the first
  slash is removed from the path name when Save dialog returns the
  file name in the function wings_file:export_filename_1/2(after
  executed wings_plugin:call_ui()). The same occurs with Open dialog
  too. It seems to be a Erlang issue (I'm not sure). I did a
  workaround, then I could Save/Export/Import using an "unc" path
  without any problem. (Thanks to jentzenm.unofficialsony that
  reported this bug) [Micheus]

- Improvements to Information line management made it auto-sizable

  Material->Select in the Outline window if selection mode isn't Face

  Now, Rename objects can be applied to several object at once, by
  using a selection or a search mask (like *box*). Also, the new name
  has a sequential number appended to it or placed in a defined
  position by using the "%" wildcard. It's possible to define the
  starter number by puting it between two "%" character (like:
  Cube%100%). [Micheus]
